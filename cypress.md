# Consistent cypress runs

### One-time-setup

```
Open two terminals one for starting project and other for cypress.
1st terminal command: npm run cypress
2st terminal command: npm run dev
```

### Run tests
``
npm run dev
npm run cypress

There is no need to repeat one-time-setup for subsequent runs
```
